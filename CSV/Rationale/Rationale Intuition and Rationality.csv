Classication of Element;Code;"Cognitive or Behavioral
Element Taken from Study";Study Code;Denition of Cognitive or Behavioral Element Taken from Study;Attributes of Intuition and Rationality from Evans (2008)
Intuition;INT;Cognitive biases;SE21;Fast, effortless, automatic, and associative conclusions that are not grounded in logic;Rapid, low effort, automatic, associative
;;Intuition;SE6;Based on feeling and experience;Associative
;;Naturalistic decision making;SE8;Satiscing the decision situation to allow for action;Associative
Rationality;RAT;Cognition;SE1;Ability to engage in process that involves rational acquisition, processing, and dissemination of information;Controlled, high effort, logical
;;Compensation;SE3;Decision making strategy based on knowledge of a trade-off between the options relevant to the decision;Controlled, high effort, sequential
;;Design reasoning;SE13;The reliance on logical and rational thinking to arrive at a decision through argumentation;Controlled, high effort, logical, rule-based
;;;SE14;Reasoning with design;Controlled
;;;SE15;Making justiable decisions by explicitly referring to design rationale;Controlled, explicit, linked to language
;;;SE17;Techniques for eliciting reasoning and other information about a design, usually during design discussions;Controlled, explicit, linked to language
;;;SE18;Reasoning with design;Controlled
;;Rational decision making;SE4;Decision makers have perfect information, and optimize from a number of alternatives, often in a linear and sequential fashion;Controlled, high effort, rule-based, sequential
;;;SE19;A decision based on the application of reason, deliberation regarding the advantages and disadvantages of available options in light of requirements and constraints;Controlled, high effort, logical, rule-based
;;;SE26;Characterized by consequential choice among alternatives, with optimizing selection process;Controlled, high effort, rule-based
;;Reflection;SE2;Process of considering multiple options and reducing cognitive biases in design decision making;Controlled, rule-based, logical
Intuition with rationality;INT, RAT;Intuition with rationality;SE9;Intuition and rationality together make up cognitive styles;
;;;;Intuition - quick, based on gut feeling;Rapid, associative
;;;;Rationality - slow, based on justication through available requirements;Slow, controlled, logical, rule-based
;;Mind 1 with mind 2;SE11, SE12;The use of mind 1 and mind 2 while making decisions during the software design process;
;;;;Mind 1 (design reasoning) - systematically reasoning with a design context: analyzing, synthesizing and evaluating design solutions;Contextualized, controlled, rule-based
;;;;Mind 2 (reection) - thinking process that allows one to evaluate, challenge and revise one’s decision, reection on one aspect of a design can spark further reection;Associative, holistic, analytic
;;Naturalistic decision making with rational decision making ;SE5;"Naturalistic- and rational decision making are used for different types of decisions; which is used depends on how much problem space exploration is required";
;;;;Naturalistic decision making - past situations are assessed and matched with the current situation through singular evaluation, in order to come to a sucient rather than optimal solution;"Associative, low effort,
pragmatic"
;;;;Rational decision making - aims to select the optimal solution in a systematic manner based on all alternatives and relevant criteria;Controlled, high-effort, rule-based
;;;SE22, SE24 SE25;"The use of dierent elements of naturalistic decision making and rational decision making in each decision making process; which combination is used depends on the structure of the problem";
;;;;Naturalistic decision making - type of decision making that emerges in chaotic situations, embodies fast reactions to changes, can cope with ambiguity, relies on situation assessment, resolved by knowledgeable decision makers, and utilizes satiscing as opposed to optimizing behaviors;Associative, contextualized, low effort, rapid
;;;;Rational decision making - decision making involving the logical application of rules to mathematically compute optimal decision among decision alternatives;Controlled, high effort, rule-based
