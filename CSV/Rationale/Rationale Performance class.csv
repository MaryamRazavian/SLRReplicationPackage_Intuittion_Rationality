Taken from Study",Study Code,"Definition of Performance Measure
Taken from Study",Relationship Found or Argued in Study,Rationale for Classification
Decision Making Process Measures,DMP,"Design discourse
quality",SE11,"The completeness, accuracy and
relevance of design discourse","Positively related to intuition
and rationality (mind 1 with
mind 2)","The discourse produced by a designer about
their own designing can be used to measure
quality of the design decision making process
that they enacted"
,,Effort,SE2,The time spent in hours on cognitive and modelling tasks,"Positively related to rational
decision making (reflective
questions)","The time spent on tasks is a performance
indicator on the level of the decision making
process"
Decision Making Outcome Measures,DO,Decision quality,SE2,Number of decisions challenged,"Positively related to rational
decision making (reective
questions)","The quality of a specic decision is a direct
outcome of that decision"
Project Outcome Measures,PO,"Software architecture
quality",SE2,Clear identifcation of design problems.,"Positively related to rational
decision making (reective
questions)","The quality of the software architecture is an
outcome of a specic project"
,,Software quality,SE1,"The extent to which the
(software) product satisfies the
requirements of its customers.","Positively related to team
cognition","The quality of the software produced by a
project is a measure of that project outcome"
,,"Software feature
novelty",SE9,Features were measured based on how novel they were perceived to be compared with existing software features from applications on the market,"Positively related to
rationality when intuition is
high (combination)","The novelty of the software feature is a measure of the outcome of the project, as each feature was designed in a standalone manner"
,,"User interface
design quality",SE15,"Positively related to rational decision
making (software design reasoning)","Usability of user interface
design based on three
heuristics: consistency,
exibility, and accessibility5",The quality of the user interface is a measure of the outcome of the project
