Taken from Study","Study
Code","Denition of Antecedent Taken
from Study","Relationship Found or
Argued in Study","Classication Explanation Using Clarke and
O’Connor (2012)",,
"Application — Attributes of
the application(s) currently
being developed",A-APP,"Agile software
development",SE3,"The use of user-centric methods
distinguished by short
development cycles, continuous
releases, and requirements that
evolve rapidly","Related to rational decision
making","The software development methodology can
vary from project (application) to project, but is
generally static across a single application under
development. Thus, agile software development
pertains to the current application(s) being
developed",,
,,"Level of
exploration of
design space
required",SE26,"The extent to which the design
space must be explored to design
a solution for the given problem5",Negatively related to rational decision making,"The extent to which the design space must be
explored is a feature of the application being
developed or modied",,
,,Sprint duration,SE4,"The time frame of the short,
intense, cycles of development5","Shorter sprint duration
negatively related to use of team rationality in scrum meetings","The duration of each sprint forms part of the
overall agile software development methodology,
which has been classied under “Application”",,
"Organization — Features of the organization within
which development is taking place",A-ORG,"Decision
viewpoints",SE19,"A documentation framework for
software architecture decisions
that addresses stakeholder
concerns",Positively related to rational decision making,"This could be part of process of tools used in
organization",,
,,Reection,SE11,"Reections emanating from
external sources such as feedback","Positively related to
combined use of intuition
and rationality","External reection could come from any source
in the organization including but not limited to
personnel, management, or a process built into
tools that are used in the software development
process",,
,,"Reective
questions",SE2,"Challenging the design decisions
made by others",Positively related to rational decision making,"Reective questions could come from any source
in the organization including but not limited to
personnel, management, or a process built into
tools that are used in the software development
process",,
,,,SE12,"Questions that are asked in order
to challenge design reasoning5",Positively related to rational decision making,"Reective questions could come from any source
in the organization including but not limited to
personnel, management, or a process built into
tools that are used in the software development
process",,
"Personnel — Characteristics
and composition of the
non-managerial personnel involved in software
development endeavors",A-PER,Experience,SE2,"Months of professional
experience in software companies","Positively related to
rationality in team setting","Classied under “Personnel” in (Clarke and
O’Connor, 2012)",,
,,,SE4,"Number of years of software
development experience5","Positively related to use of
team rationality in scrum
meetings","Classied under “Personnel” in (Clarke and
O’Connor, 2012)",,
,,"Resource
availability",SE4,"The availability of key human
expertise from the team during a
particular point in the sprint5","Lack of resource availability
is negatively related to use of
team rationality in scrum
meetings","The study frames resource availability as
availability of team members with specic
expertise",,
,,Team climate,SE1,"The combination of attitudes,
expectations, and norms that are
perceived by team members in
order for them to function within
a specic context","Positively related to team
rationality","Conceptualized in the study in terms of team
member beliefs and behaviors",,
"Requirements —
Characteristics of the
business and user
requirements for the product",A-REQ,Problem structure,"SE22, SE25","The more structured a problem is,
the easier it is to map elements of
the problem domain to
characteristics of a
problem-solving method5",Different levels dictate which elements of intuition and rationality are used,"The structure of the problem is related to the
requirements for the product",,
"Technology — Nature of the technology utilized in
software development
endeavors",A-TEC,"Software design
reasoning card
game",SE13,"A card game based on the
identication of assumptions,
risks, and constrains, as well as
carrying our trade-offs and
articulating contexts, problems,
and solutions",Positively related to rationality,"This could be part of the tools or technologies
used",,
