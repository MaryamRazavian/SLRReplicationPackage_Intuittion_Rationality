### Abstract 

**Abstract:** Context. As society’s reliance on software systems escalates over time, so too does the cost
of failure of these systems. Meanwhile, the complexity of software systems, as well as their design, is
also ever-increasing, influenced by the proliferation of new tools and technologies to address societal
needs. The traditional response to this complexity in software engineering and software architecture
has been to apply rational approaches to software design, through methods and tools for capturing
design rationale and software architecture knowledge management. However, research from other fields
demonstrates that intuition may also hold benefits for making complex design decisions. All humans,
including software designers, make use of both intuition and rationality in varying combinations.
Objective. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive overview of what is known and
unknown from existing research regarding the use and performance consequences of using intuition and
rationality in software design decision- making.
Methods. To this end, a systematic literature review has been conducted, with an initial sample of
3909 unique publications.
Results. We propose (1) an overview of existing research, based on the literature concerning intuition
and rationality use in software design decision-making; and (2) a research agenda with fourteen future
research questions, that should encourage researchers to fill identified research gaps. The research
agenda and corresponding research questions were developed by means of a narrative synthesis, by
reflecting on the research gaps based on findings concerning the use of intuition and rationality in
decision-making from other domains. Conclusions. This research agenda emphasizes what should be
investigated to be able to develop support for the application of the two cognitive processes in software
design decision-making.
